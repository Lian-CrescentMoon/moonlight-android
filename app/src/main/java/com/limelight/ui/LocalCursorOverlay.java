// Local patch (2026-09-20): a cursor drawn by the app on top of the stream.
//
// While the pointer is captured Android draws no cursor, so the only pointer on screen is the one the host
// paints into the video - a full round trip behind the finger. This overlay moves with the touchpad at once.
//
// It also OWNS the pointer position: every move is sent to the host as an absolute position instead of a
// relative delta. That keeps the two cursors on the same spot (the host one simply arrives later, which the
// user asked for) and means clicks land where the drawn cursor is.
//
// The position is kept as a fraction of the video, and the fraction is turned into screen pixels with the
// RENDERED rectangle of the stream view (its layout size times its scale, at its current position). The
// layout size alone is wrong: measured 2026-09-20 on a Tab S7+, the view was laid out 2701x1690 and scaled
// by 1.037 to fill the 2800x1752 panel, and using the layout size put the host cursor 3.7 % further from
// the top left corner than the drawn one, growing with the distance.
//
// 2026-09-23: absolute positions bypass Windows' own pointer speed and "Enhance pointer precision", so the
// drawn cursor felt slow and linear next to the plain relative mode. The overlay now applies the host's
// acceleration itself. The curve was MEASURED on the host: single relative moves injected with SendInput
// (the same input Sunshine produces), 25 samples each, medians, with the user's settings (pointer speed
// 14/20, enhanced precision on). Diagonal moves confirmed that Windows takes max(|dx|,|dy|) + min/2 as the
// speed, not the vector length (the length model missed by up to 3 px at 10-16 units, this one fits every
// point). The speed setting is an extra factor on top; 100 % is the same as the PC's own mouse.
